# MariobrOS

Currently following "The little book about OS development" and http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/irqs.htm and http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/6.-Paging.html

Packages used: bochs (bochs-sdl) bochs-x genisoimage nasm build-essential

How to run: make will run bochs, you have to type c in the console to tell it to continue

- build:    intermediary files
- bochs:    config, logs, etc for bochs
- doc:      tutorials used (useful when offline)
- iso:      the contents of the iso
- kernel:   legacy C kernel (unused yet)
- src:      I'm amazed it wasn't in the list and nobody noticed it
